## UNIX Network Programming

### Project Description

Social networks are nowadays in every moment of our lives. The information built upon interactions among people has led to different types of applications. Crowdsourced apps such as Uber, Lyft, Waze use information for navigation purposes. Other apps such as dating apps provide matching algorithms to connect users who share similar behaviours and increase their compatibility chances for future success. In this project we shall implement a simplified version of a matching app that'll help us understand how matching systems work in the real world. Specifically, you'll be given a network topology consisting of social connections between different users in the network. This will consist of nodes representing users and the edges between them. Beside social network topology, you will also be given a database consisting of compatibility test scores. This database will be in plain text and consist of multiple key (the user), value (the corresponding score) pairs.
